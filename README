OVERVIEW

Mail::POP3 is a working POP3 server module, with a working mpopd that
can either work as a standalone, be called from inetd, or be used in
non-forking mode for use on Windows platforms that do not do forking
correctly.

SCRIPTS

mpopd - the core. Read this to see how to use modules.
mpopdctl - gives command-line control of a running mpopd.
mpopdstats - gives command-line statistics from mpopd.
installscript - helps install mpopd and create configuration.
update-conf - helps you upgrade an older config (the file format changed).

DESIGN

It is designed as follows:
Mail::POP3::Daemon does the socket-accepting.
Mail::POP3::Server does (most of) the network POP3 stuff.
Mail::POP3::Security::{User,Connection} do the checks on users and connections.
Mail::POP3::Folder::* classes handles the mail folders.

This last characteristic means that diverse sources of information can
be served up as though they are a POP3 mailbox by implementing a M::P::F
subclass. An example is provided in M::P::F::webscrape.

FUTURE

This module will become a Net::Server subclass, such that the Folder
functionality will be folded back into the server, in a class called
(probably) Net::Server::POP3::webscrape (etc).
