Tidy mailbox object creation to just 1 sub in conf
Mailbox-making should die if fails, give text to user

Make Folder->retrieve and ->top just return the text, not print it to fh

Fix Received: headers in ::jobserve so OE doesn't show incorrect time

Sort Mail::POP3::Daemon and SIGUSR1 vs re-reading config. Do in
    surrounding script, or pass 'config_file' in config hash?
    Have Daemon->start return a value that means pass in new config?

Make README give accurate install process

Rationalise installscript, mpopdctl, mpopdstats

Document main classes, inc Mail::POP3::Server::load_class
